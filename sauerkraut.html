    <p>I came up with this recipe for brats and sauerkraut because simply simmering sausages in beer and onions tasted weak. I was looking for a more intense beer flavor with a little bite, and this is it. It's a very satisfying dish if you crave German flavor that's Americanized. We love this dish served on potato rolls with spicy hot German mustard, Swiss cheese, and an ice-cold beer on the side.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon celery seeds</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lager beer</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh bratwurst sausages</li>
        <li>1 pound sauerkraut (preferably barrel-aged), drained</li>
    </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Crush celery seeds and caraway seeds with a mortar and pestle until ground.</li>
        <li>Mix beer, brown sugar, dry mustard, onion powder, pepper, dill, and crushed seeds together in a bowl until brown sugar is dissolved. </li>
        <li>Place brats into a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour beer mixture over top and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and increase the heat to medium. Boil the sauce until it reduces to a thick, syrupy liquid, about 20 minutes. Tilt the skillet to roll brats in the sticky sauce until thoroughly coated. Transfer brats to a plate and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add sauerkraut to the skillet and stir to combine with any leftover sauce; cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer sauerkraut to a serving platter and top with warm brats.</li>
       </ol>
